Place a CJK font file here for PDF export

To ensure Chinese text renders correctly in exported PDFs, download a font with Chinese glyph support (e.g., Noto Sans SC Regular) and save it as:

  public/fonts/NotoSansSC-Regular.ttf

Recommended font:
- Noto Sans SC Regular (OFL license)
- Download: https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans+SC

After placing the file, re-run the app. The export PDF feature will auto-embed this font.
